An exploration of COVID-19 data for countries and its relationship with other development indicators

In this notebook I am going to explore COVID-19 from two sources: Worldometer and data from John Hopkins University. There is some cleaning of the Worldometer data required in order to match data latitude and longitude data from a CSV file which I then merged. I then used the data to plot the top 20 countries by cases, and used the bubble size to represent size of population. In the next visualisation exercise I used the data from John Hopkins University to develop time series plots for cases, deaths, and recoveries firstly for South Africa over time and then for an interactive plot that allows the user to specify the country they want to look at. All data in the modelling is real-time. Finally I created a plotted country cases onto a world map. In the second part of the exercise I explored a set of independent variables of data for countries including population density, the gini coefficient, life expectancy, the human development index, rule of law, government effectiveness, and political stability. I used multiple linear regression to determine how much variability in cases, deaths, and recoveries respectively could be explained by these variables, and considered multi-collinearity using Variance Inflation Factors.
